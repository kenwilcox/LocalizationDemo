Playing around with Localization

This was a whole lot easier than I thought. Adding another language was pretty simple.

German and Japanese language support. Well, Google Translate versions.

Make sure to select the German or Japanese scheme to have it load that.

I don't believe I got the launch screen correct. I still see the English one.
