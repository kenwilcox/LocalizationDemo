Playing around with Localization

This was a whole lot easier than I thought. Adding another language was pretty simple.

German, Japanese, and French language support. Well, Google Translate versions.

Make sure to select the German, Japanese, or French scheme to have it load that.

I don't believe I got the launch screen correct. I still see the English one.
